I am doing this for a hackathon, which will end in about 10 hours, give me a detailed plan and tasks that will make me most likely to win the project. I have an existing project from the aptos block explorer, which I plan to for the zk scan, Suggest what can be modified. Also the scroll have a bounty for the hackathon, is ther a way that I can incorporate some of the elements into the project? It's fine if the answer is no too, I don't want to force fit my solution into it, but will be good if there are any too.

More info about the bounty:
